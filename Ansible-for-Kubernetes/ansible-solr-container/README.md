# Ansible Apache Solr Container Example

Most people build containers using a `Dockerfile`, but it's easy (and sometimes much more manageable) to build containers other ways.

In this example, Ansible is used to:

  1. Start a container.
  2. Run Ansible roles to install Java and Apache Solr on the container.
  3. Commit the container image.
  4. Stop and remove the container.

Effectively the same as using a `Dockerfile` and `docker build`, but built using Ansible's automation engine, which offers more flexibility for advanced use cases, or supporting numerous different base images and distributionsâ€”or for supporting an application build on both legacy servers and inside containers, with shared automation and configuration code.

> If you want a maintained Apache Solr container to use in your infrastructure, I recommend using the [`geerlingguy/solr` image](https://hub.docker.com/r/geerlingguy/solr/), available on Docker Hub. It is built [using a similar playbook](https://github.com/geerlingguy/solr-container), but is available to pull from anywhere, and has tags available for many Solr versions.

## Usage

This playbook assumes you have Docker CE, Ansible (`pip[3] install ansible`), and the Docker Python library installed (`pip[3] install docker`).

### Building the Container

In this playbook directory, install dependencies from Ansible Galaxy:

    ansible-galaxy install -r requirements.yml

Run the playbook to build the Apache Solr container image:

    ansible-playbook -i inventory main.yml

### Testing the Container

A `test.yml` playbook is included which runs a container with the image the `main.yml` built, then verifies Solr starts and runs correctly, then stops and removes the container. To run the test playbook:

    ansible-playbook -i inventory test.yml
